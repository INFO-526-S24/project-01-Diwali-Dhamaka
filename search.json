Several transactions are tied to the same customer. Of the transactions, 12 transactions did not have information regarding the sale price of the transaction and will be excluded from the data.\n-Nine variables detail customer identification and demographics.\n-Two variables identify the type of product sold in a given transaction.\n-Two variables detail the size of the transaction.\nA more in depth description of the variables can be seen in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\nVariable\nClass\nDescription\nValues\n\n\n\n\nUser_ID\nDouble\nUser ID number\nSeven digit unique number\n\n\nCust_name\nCharacter\nCustomer name\nName\n\n\nProduct_ID\nCharacter\nProduct ID number\nProduct Code\n\n\nGender\nCharacter\nGender (e.g. Male, Female)\nF/M\n\n\nAge.Group\nCharacter\nAge group\n0-17, 18-25, 26-35, 36-45, 46-50, 51-55, 55+\n\n\nAge\nDouble\nAge\n12-92\n\n\nMarital_Status\nDouble\nMarital status (e.g. Married, Single)\n0/1 recoded as Single/Married\n\n\nState\nCharacter\nState\n16 states\n\n\nZone\nCharacter\nGeographic zone\nNorthern, Southern, Eastern, Western, Central\n\n\nOccupation\nCharacter\nOccupation\n15 professions\n\n\nProduct_Category\nCharacter\nCategory of the product\n18 product categories\n\n\nOrders\nDouble\nNumber of orders\n1-4\n\n\nAmount\nDouble\nIndian rupees spent by the customer\n188-23952\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGender and Marital_Status are used as broad demographic subsets to see the number of transactions made for the Product_Category. Gender and Marital_Status were specifically chosen for being traits that are easily identifiable.\nOrder, despite representing the number of orders for a transaction was not selected as the outcome variable. This decision was made because the types of categories present varied greatly (ie. Auto and Tupperware). Because of the inherent differences between categories, it is unlikely that order numbers between categories would be comparable.\nUser_ID, Gender, Age, and Amount are used to answer the question of how the customer’s demographics will affect the amount they will spend at the festival. User_ID and Age are used to group the customer data so that each row will represent a unique customer. Using the customer’s age will also ensure that multiple years worth of transactions are separated accordingly. This will help ensure changes in demographics won’t be lost in merging the data by Customer_ID alone. Amount is used to generate the response variable by summing the values based on the grouping of the data.\nState, Occupation, and Zone are under consideration for potential variables.\nCust_name is not utilized because the variable is an identifier and is not expected to generate information meaningful for marketing and business strategies.\nProduct_ID is not utilized because the variable does not contain information regarding what the product is.\nAge.Group is currently not under consideration for analysis since the variable is represented in Age. It is used for data cleaning of Marital_Status, as mentioned in the data wrangling section."

    "text": "Data Wrangling\n\nMarital_Status:\nThe minimum legal age to marry in India is 18 for women and 21 for men. Several customers were coded as married at illegal ages. These were likely errors in data entry. To address this issue, we recoded the entries for Marital_Status of customers from 1 to 0 in compliance with the legal marriage ages. Customers indicated to be under the age of 18 using variable Age.Group were defaulted to 0 for Marital_Status using the mutate and case_when functions. Additionally, a second condition in the case_when function was that if a customer was both male and under 21, Marital_Status would be coded as 0.\nFor ease of interpretation, Marital_Status was further modifed using another mutate and case_when function to recode 0 as Single and 1 as Married.\n\n\nProduct_Category\nUsing the mutate and case_when functions, Product_Category was reduced from 18 categories into 8 based on similarities of the initial categories. This is done because goods which are coded as differently in Product_category are likely to be sold in the same business if the products fall under a larger category. This subsetting of the Product_Category has the added benefit of minimizing plot clutter. The details can be found in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct_Category\nAdjusted Category\n\n\n\n\nAuto\nAuto\n\n\nBeauty\nBeauty\n\n\nClothing & Apparel\nClothing\n\n\nFootwear & Shoes\nClothing\n\n\nBooks\nEntertainment\n\n\nElectronics & Gadgets\nEntertainment\n\n\nGames & Toys\nEntertainment\n\n\nSports Products\nEntertainment\n\n\nFood\nFood\n\n\nDecor\nHome\n\n\nFurniture\nHome\n\n\nHand & Power Tools\nHome\n\n\nHousehold items\nHome\n\n\nTupperware\nHome\n\n\nOffice\nOffice\n\n\nStationery\nOffice\n\n\nPet Care\nPet Care\n\n\nVeterinary\nPet Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmount\nFor our second question of interest, we are interested in assessing how a customer’s demographics affect how much they will spend. To do this, a second dataset was generated using the group_by function according to User_ID and Age. This is because a customer can have multiple purchases. Additionally, the changing ages for a customer suggests that the dataset covers transactions over several years. Because several column values such as Occupation have different entries for the same customer, it is prudent to assess the same customer with differing ages as separate transactions to more accurately analyze the effect of the demographic on Amount.\nAfter using the group_by function, the data used the summarize function in order to sum the Amount as Total. This new variable now displays the total amount spent a customer spent in that year’s Diwali festival."
