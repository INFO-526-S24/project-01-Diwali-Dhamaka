This decision was made because the types of categories present varied greatly (ie. Auto and Tupperware). Because of the inherent differences between categories, it is unlikely that order numbers between categories would be comparable.\nUser_ID, Gender, Age, and Amount are used to answer the question of how the customer’s demographics will affect the amount they will spend at the festival. User_ID and Age are used to group the customer data so that each row will represent a unique customer. Using the customer’s age will also ensure that multiple years worth of transactions are separated accordingly. This will help ensure changes in demographics won’t be lost in merging the data by Customer_ID alone. Amount is used to generate the response variable by summing the values based on the grouping of the data.\nState, Occupation, and Zone are under consideration for potential variables.\nCust_name is not utilized because the variable is an identifier and is not expected to generate information meaningful for marketing and business strategies.\nProduct_ID is not utilized because the variable does not contain information regarding what the product is.\nAge.Group is currently not under consideration for analysis since the variable is represented in Age.

    "section": "Data Wrangling",
    "text": "Data Wrangling\nFor the data wrangling, we utilized the dplyr package.\n\nMarital_Status:\nThe minimum legal age to marry in India is 18 for women and 21 for men. Several customers were coded as married at illegal ages. These were likely errors in data entry. To address this issue, we recoded the entries for Marital_Status of customers from 1 to 0 in compliance with the legal marriage ages. Customers indicated to be under the age of 18 using variable Age.Group were defaulted to 0 for Marital_Status using the mutate and case_when functions. Additionally, a second condition in the case_when function was that if a customer was both male and under 21, Marital_Status would be coded as 0.\nFor ease of interpretation, Marital_Status was further modifed using another mutate and case_when function to recode 0 as Single and 1 as Married.\n\n\nProduct_Category\nUsing the mutate and case_when functions, Product_Category was reduced from 18 categories into 8 based on similarities of the initial categories. This is done because goods which are coded as differently in Product_category are likely to be sold in the same business if the products fall under a larger category. This subsetting of the Product_Category has the added benefit of minimizing plot clutter. The details can be found in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct_Category\nAdjusted Category\n\n\n\n\nAuto\nAuto\n\n\nBeauty\nBeauty\n\n\nClothing & Apparel\nClothing\n\n\nFootwear & Shoes\nClothing\n\n\nBooks\nEntertainment\n\n\nElectronics & Gadgets\nEntertainment\n\n\nGames & Toys\nEntertainment\n\n\nSports Products\nEntertainment\n\n\nFood\nFood\n\n\nDecor\nHome\n\n\nFurniture\nHome\n\n\nHand & Power Tools\nHome\n\n\nHousehold items\nHome\n\n\nTupperware\nHome\n\n\nOffice\nOffice\n\n\nStationery\nOffice\n\n\nPet Care\nPet Care\n\n\nVeterinary\nPet Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAmount\nFor our second question of interest, we are interested in assessing how a customer’s demographics affect how much they will spend. To do this, a second dataset was generated using the group_by function according to User_ID and Age. This is because a customer can have multiple purchases. Additionally, the changing ages for a customer suggests that the dataset covers transactions over several years. Because several column values such as Occupation have different entries for the same customer, it is prudent to assess the same customer with differing ages as separate transactions to more accurately analyze the effect of the demographic on Amount.\nAfter using the group_by function, the data used the summarize function in order to sum the Amount as Total. This new variable now displays the total amount spent a customer spent in that year’s Diwali festival."

    "text": "What are the most popular product category according to customer demographics?\nThe title should relate to the question you’re answering.\n\nIntroduction\n(1-2 paragraphs): Introduction to the question and what parts of the dataset are necessary to answer the question. Also discuss why you’re interested in this question.\nBecause we are looking at transactional data, a natural question to ask is what is the demographic that engages in the highest number of transactions for any given product. Finding these patterns can be useful in guiding businesses in directing their efforts on attracting customers whose demographics make such purchases, or by highlighting potentially untapped customer groups. In order to develop strategies at the ground level, visible customer features, such as gender and marital status, were utilized to subset the customer groups. Transaction counts were tied to the product category since customer interest would likely fluctuate depending on the products sold.\nBecause product price of certain categories can differ greatly from those of another category, product price could affect a customer’s decision to make a purchase. This potential confounding from product price is assessed by finding individual order prices by taking the amount spent per order and comparing the range of values across the product categories.\n\n\nApproach\n(1-2 paragraphs): Describe what types of plots you are going to make to address your question. For each plot, provide a clear explanation as to why this plot (e.g. boxplot, barplot, histogram, etc.) is best for providing the information you are asking about. The two plots should be of different types, and at least one of the two plots needs to use either color mapping or facets.\nA barplot was used to assess the relationship between product category and its interest within a customer demographic. This plot visualizes the number of transactions for each product category and is able to separate the bars according to the features of interest. The count of each transaction is particularly important since any sale leads to profit regardless of order size. The barplot’s visualizations also help give us both an absolute and relevant gauge of interest as the length of the bars can be compared to each other.\nA boxplot was then used to assess if item price could have affected the number of transactions a product category had. The boxplot provides several important statistics such as the interquartile range that gives a clearer picture on how similar or different item prices between categories are. Because prices are likely to remain the same regardless of the customer, gender and marital status are not utilized for this plot.\n\n\nAnalysis\n(2-3 code blocks, 2 figures, text/code comments as needed): In this section, provide the code that generates your plots. Use scale functions to provide nice axis labels and guides. You are welcome to use theme functions to customize the appearance of your plot, but you are not required to do so. All plots must be made with ggplot2.

Identify any trends revealed (or not revealed) by the plots. Speculate about why the data looks the way it does.\nThe barplot indicated that the number of female customers was more than double the number of male customers for most product categories. Additionally, customers who were single made more transactions than customers who were married across all product categories. The majority of transactions were made with clothing, entertainment, and food. Considering the transaction are for the festival, it is unsurprising that local food, games, and regional clothing would be the most sought commodities.\nThe boxplot showed that prices across product categories were within the whisker range aside from auto and pet care. Auto had the largest range and highest median price, which makes sense since auto sales are going to be more costly and variable compared to any of the other categories. The overlapping ranges of item price suggests that item price likely does not have an effect on a customer’s purchasing pattern."

Outliers appear to be less prevalent for the youngest and oldest age groups. Results suggest that\nRegressions of the total customer spending suggests that marital status does not have an effect on total rupees spent on a transaction. Interestingly, women exhibit a polynomial relationship between age and spending total while men showed a flat line. Slope analysis for men suggest that the slope is insignificant at a 0.05 \\(\\alpha\\)-level, and that men purchase total is unaffected by age. The differences in regressions could be due to different shopping approaches between genders such as men working with a specific budget in mind and women shopping according to needs."
