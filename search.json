    "section": "Data Wrangling",
    "text": "Data Wrangling\nFor the data wrangling, we utilized the dplyr package.\n\nAge.Group:\nIt is notable that much of the information of customers below 18 are neither possible nor legal. Due to these issues, transactions with customers coded 0-17 for Age.Group were excluded from the analysis.\n\n\nMarital_Status:\nThe minimum legal age to marry in India is 18 for women and 21 for men. Several customers were coded as married at illegal ages. These were likely errors in data entry. To address this issue, we recoded the entries for Marital_Status of customers from 1 to 0 in compliance with the legal marriage ages. Customers indicated to be both male and under 21 using variable Age.Group were defaulted to 0 for Marital_Status using the mutate and case_when functions.\nFor ease of interpretation, Marital_Status was further modifed using another mutate and case_when function to recode 0 as Single and 1 as Married.\n\n\nProduct_Category\nUsing the mutate and case_when functions, Product_Category was reduced from 18 categories into 8 based on similarities of the initial categories. This is done because goods which are coded as differently in Product_category are likely to be sold in the same business if the products fall under a larger category. This subsetting of the Product_Category has the added benefit of minimizing plot clutter. The details can be found in the following table:\n\n\n\n\n\nProduct_Category\nAdjusted Category\n\n\n\n\nAuto\nAuto\n\n\nBeauty\nBeauty\n\n\nClothing & Apparel\nClothing\n\n\nFootwear & Shoes\nClothing\n\n\nBooks\nEntertainment\n\n\nElectronics & Gadgets\nEntertainment\n\n\nGames & Toys\nEntertainment\n\n\nSports Products\nEntertainment\n\n\nFood\nFood\n\n\nDecor\nHome\n\n\nFurniture\nHome\n\n\nHand & Power Tools\nHome\n\n\nHousehold items\nHome\n\n\nTupperware\nHome\n\n\nOffice\nOffice\n\n\nStationery\nOffice\n\n\nPet Care\nPet Care\n\n\nVeterinary\nPet Care\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrice\nIn our first question, we are concerned with finding purchasing trends across Product_Category. One potential confounding issue is that item price can vary between categories, which could influence purchasing patterns. A new variable was generated by dividing a transaction’s Amount by Orders. This process calculates the price of each individual order in the transaction.\n\n\nTotal\nFor our second question of interest, we are interested in assessing how a customer’s demographics affect how much they will spend. To do this, a second dataset was generated using the group_by function according to User_ID and Age. This is because a customer can have multiple purchases. Additionally, the changing ages for a customer suggests that the dataset covers transactions over several years. Because several column values such as Occupation have different entries for the same customer, it is prudent to assess the same customer with differing ages as separate transactions to more accurately analyze the effect of the demographic on Amount.\nAfter using the group_by function, the data used the summarize function in order to sum the Amount as Total. This new variable now displays the total amount spent a customer spent in that year’s Diwali festival."

    "text": "What is the most prevalent customer group for each product category?\n\nIntroduction\nA natural direction when looking at transactional data is to find which demographic engages in the highest number of transactions for any given business. Finding these patterns can be helfpul for businesses in increasing revenue in multiple ways such as knowing which products to focus on, which kind of customers to target, or highlighting potentially untapped customer groups. In order to answer this question, features Gender, Marital_Status, Product_Category, Orders, and Amount are used. Orders and Amount are specifically used to address one potential confounding factor by calculating Price.\n\n\nApproach\nA barplot was used to assess the relationship between product category and its interest within a customer demographic. This plot visualizes the number of transactions for each product category, differences in gender using different bar colors, and marital status using facet wraps. The count of each transaction is particularly important since any sale leads to profit regardless of order size. The barplot’s visualizations also help give us both an absolute and relevant gauge of interest as the lengths of the bars can be compared to each other.\nIt is reasonable to believe that product prices could affect the number of transactions and be a confounding factor for customer demographic analysis. To assess if product price is introducing potential effects on the number of sales, a boxplot of product category prices is generated. The boxplot provides several important statistics such as the interquartile range that gives a clearer picture of how similar or different item prices between categories are. Because prices are likely to remain the same regardless of the customer, gender and marital status are not utilized for this plot.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n# Read in project data\ndiwali &lt;- read.csv(\"data/diwali_sales_data.csv\")\n\n# Remove NA values\ndiwali &lt;- diwali[-which(is.na(diwali$Amount)),]\n\n# Remove lowest age group due to inherent issues\ndiwali &lt;- diwali[-which(diwali$Age.Group == \"0-17\"),]\n\n# Recode marital status in case age value is illegal\ndiwali &lt;- diwali |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    Marital_Status = case_when(\n      Age &lt; 21 & Gender ==\"M\" ~ 0,\n      TRUE ~ Marital_Status\n    )\n  )\n\n# Modify dataset according to project analysis\ndiwali &lt;- diwali |&gt;\n  mutate(\n    # Refactorizes the product category based on similarity between products\n    Product_Category = case_when(\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Footwear & Shoes\") ~ \"Clothing\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Clothing & Apparel\") ~ \"Clothing\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Books\") ~ \"Entertainment\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Electronics & Gadgets\") ~ \"Entertainment\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Games & Toys\") ~ \"Entertainment\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Sports Products\") ~ \"Entertainment\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Decor\") ~ \"Home\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Furniture\") ~ \"Home\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Hand & Power Tools\") ~ \"Home\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Household items\") ~ \"Home\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Tupperware\") ~ \"Home\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Stationery\") ~ \"Office\",\n      Product_Category %in% c(\"Veterinary\") ~ \"Pet Care\",\n      TRUE ~ Product_Category\n      ),\n    \n    # Refactorizes the marital status to detail the meaning\n    Marital_Status = case_when(\n      Marital_Status %in% 1 ~ \"Married\",\n      Marital_Status %in% 0 ~ \"Single\"\n      ),\n    \n    # Calculate the price of item within each transaction\n    Price = Amount/Orders\n  )\n\n# Sort Gender factor level\ndiwali$Gender &lt;- factor(diwali$Gender, levels = c(\"M\", \"F\"))\n\n# Sort Marital_Status factor level\ndiwali$Marital_Status &lt;- factor(diwali$Marital_Status,\n                                levels = c(\"Single\", \"Married\"))\n\n\n# Check the number of product categories for refactor level\ncategory_order &lt;- as.data.frame(matrix(nrow = 8, ncol = 2))\ncategory_order[,1] &lt;- c(\"Auto\", \"Beauty\", \"Clothing\", \"Entertainment\", \"Food\",\n                    \"Home\", \"Office\", \"Pet Care\")\ncategory_order[,2] &lt;- as.integer(summary(as.factor(diwali$Product_Category)))\ncategory_vector &lt;- (category_order[order(category_order[,2]),1])\n\n# Refactorizes the product category to sort the groups by count\ndiwali$Product_Category &lt;- as.factor(diwali$Product_Category)\ndiwali$Product_Category &lt;- factor(diwali$Product_Category,\n                                  levels = category_vector)\n\n# Bar plot showing the number of customers for product category across gender\n# and marital status\nggplot(data = diwali, aes(y = Product_Category, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_bar(position = \"dodge\", width = 0.7) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"dodgerblue\", \"deeppink1\")) +\n  # Reorder legend to match the order of the bar plot\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Total Count of Sale Type\",\n          \"Across gender and marital status\") +\n  facet_wrap(~Marital_Status, ncol = 1) +\n  ylab(\"Product Category\") +\n  xlab(\"Counts\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Check the average order price of product category\ndiwali_price &lt;- diwali |&gt;\n  group_by(Product_Category) |&gt;\n  summarize(\"Price\" = median(Amount/Orders))\ndiwali_price &lt;- as.data.frame(diwali_price)\ncategory_vector &lt;- diwali_price[order(diwali_price[,2]),1]\n\n# Refactorizes the product category to sort the groups by count\ndiwali$Product_Category &lt;- factor(diwali$Product_Category,\n                                  levels = rev(category_vector))\n\n# Boxplot of average order values per category\nggplot(data = diwali,\n       aes(x = Product_Category, y = Amount/Orders)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 1e-3, suffix = \"K\")) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Product Price Range\",\n          \"Ordered by median order price\") +\n  xlab(\"Product Category\") +\n  ylab(\"Order Price (Rupee)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe barplot indicated that the number of female customers was more than double the number of male customers for most product categories. This difference could be attributed to a difference in culture in which men are expected to purchase corporate gifts (sweets and souvenirs) for business associates while women are expected to purchase gifts for families and friends, who are more likely to desire the specified product categories in this dataset. Additionally, customers who were single made more transactions than customers who were married across all product categories. This could be because single people only need to consider their own purchases and not others in the family. The majority of transactions were made with clothing, entertainment, and food. Considering the transactions are for the festival, it is likely that local food, games, and regional clothing would be highlights of the festival.\nThe boxplot shows that prices across product categories were within the whisker range aside from auto and pet care. Median values for each product category did not have a pattern consistent with the barplot. These two details suggest that order price does not have a confounding effect on the transaction numbers of our subgroups.\nAn interesting detail to note is that auto had the largest range and highest median price, which is likely due to the range of potential items associated with auto such as car accessories, auto parts, or services."

    "text": "How does age affect a customer’s total spending during the festival?\n\nIntroduction\nWhen analyzing customer demographics, age is another feature that is often focused on since age is often associated with several other features such as generational differences, employment status, disposable income, etc. Because of potential changes in spending habits, we are interested in seeing how age can affect how much a customer will spend at the festival. In addition to Gender and Marital_Status used in the previous question, we also look at Age, Age.Group, User_ID, and Amount. Age and Age.Group are used as the independent variables of our plots. User_ID and Age are used to group customers so that Amount can be summed to determine the amount a customer spends at that year’s festival (Total).\n\n\nApproach\nWe plan on assessing how age is related to spending total when age is either a categorical variable (age group) or continuous variable (age). Performing the analysis using age group gives more insight to spending habits of customers based on maturity. Gender and marital status are also assessed since results from the previous question have shown an impact of these features on the number of transactions and could have a possible impact on total spending.\nA boxplot is implemented when age group is used. This visualization is useful to show several important statistical values such as the interquartile range. Comparison of the total spending ranges across customers at different age groups is visualized by simply comparing the boxes horizontally. In addition, a regression is implemented using age as a continuous variable. This visualization is useful in directly mapping the relationship between a customer’s age and total spending.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\n# Modify data for Q2\ndiwali.Q2 &lt;- diwali |&gt;\n  group_by(User_ID, Age) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    \"Gender\" = first(Gender),\n    \"Age_Group\" = first(Age.Group),\n    \"Marital_Status\" = first(Marital_Status),\n    \"Total\" = sum(Amount))\n\n\n# Boxplot to show customer spending within age group\nggplot(data = diwali.Q2,\n       aes(x = Age_Group, y = Total, fill = Gender)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 1e-3, suffix = \"K\")) +\n  scale_fill_manual(values = c(\"dodgerblue\", \"deeppink1\")) +\n  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(0, 80000)) +\n  facet_wrap(~Marital_Status, ncol = 2) +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Spending Range of Customer Demographic\", \"By age group\") +\n  xlab(\"Age Group\") +\n  ylab(\"Customer Spending (Rupees)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Sort Gender factor level\ndiwali.Q2$Gender &lt;- factor(diwali.Q2$Gender, levels = c(\"M\", \"F\"))\n\n# Plot Q2 data\nggplot(data = diwali.Q2, aes(x = Age, y = Total, color = Gender)) +\n  geom_smooth(linewidth = 2)  +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = label_number(scale = 1e-3, suffix = \"K\")) +\n  facet_wrap(~Marital_Status, ncol = 2) +\n  scale_color_manual(values = c(\"dodgerblue\", \"deeppink1\")) +\n  guides(color = guide_legend(reverse = TRUE)) +\n  ggtitle(\"Customer Demographic Spending Insights\",\n          \"Over age\") +\n  ylab(\"Customer Spending (Rupees)\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n# Split data into two subsets\ndiwali_single &lt;- diwali.Q2[which(diwali.Q2$Marital_Status == \"Single\" &\n                               diwali.Q2$Gender == \"M\"),]\n\ndiwali_married &lt;- diwali.Q2[which(diwali.Q2$Marital_Status == \"Married\" &\n                               diwali.Q2$Gender == \"M\"),]\n\n# Generate linear models\nsingle_lm &lt;- lm(Total~Age, data = diwali_single)\nmarried_lm &lt;- lm(Total~Age, data = diwali_married)\n\n# Round values of tidy objects\ntidy_single &lt;- tidy(single_lm)\ntidy_single[,2:ncol(tidy_single)] &lt;- round(tidy_single[, 2:ncol(tidy_single)], 2)\ntidy_married &lt;- tidy(married_lm)\ntidy_married[,2:ncol(tidy_married)] &lt;- round(tidy_married[, 2:ncol(tidy_married)], 2)\n\n# Generate a nice table with kable\nsingle_table &lt;- kable(tidy_single, \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n# Generate a nice table with kable\nmarried_table &lt;- kable(tidy_married, \"html\") %&gt;%\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n\n# Display the table\nsingle_table\nmarried_table\n\nSingle Men\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n12586.53\n676.70\n18.60\n0.00\n\n\nAge\n-13.32\n17.37\n-0.77\n0.44\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMarried Men\n\n\n\n\n\nterm\nestimate\nstd.error\nstatistic\np.value\n\n\n\n\n(Intercept)\n12531.36\n1304.79\n9.60\n0.00\n\n\nAge\n-9.02\n32.40\n-0.28\n0.78\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDiscussion\nThe boxplot shows that interquartile range of the total rupees spent at the festival does not fluctuate greatly across age groups regardless of gender and marital status. The consistency of values could be the result of customers having a perception of how much spending is normal that does not greatly deviate across age. Female customers appear to have larger outlier values and higher prevalence compared to their male counterparts across almost every subgroup. We, as a group, refuse to put forward a reason for this in absence of any clear or known substantiation for this behavior.\nFrom the regression, it is noticeable male spending is consistent across all ages regardless of marital status. The consistent spending could be attributed to the fact that festivals are more driven by women. Spending of female customers peaks approximately at age 50. The shift in spending could be attributed to disposable income in relation to the age of dependent family members.\nDue to the flat linear appearance of men’s spending, slope analysis was performed for both single and married men. The p-values were larger than \\(\\alpha\\) = 0.05 for both. This indicates that men’s spending is unaffected by age."
